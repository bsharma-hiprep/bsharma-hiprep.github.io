# About me

Baibhav a.k.a. B here, your friendly neighborhood basic nerd hipster. I like math, although I am bad at it. I did Physics in college at toothpaste I mean Colgate University. And now I am a incoming Program in Systems Neuroscience PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University. In the most abstract terms, I am interested in understanding the whys and hows of computations in natural and artificial intelligent systems. As someone gifted with ADHD and some other neurodivergent things, I like to indulge in specific passion phases. Current ones are building this webpage and thinking about ergodicity in learning (wth??). I know little (and understand even less) about a lot of things. So join me for mathly and sciencey shenanigans and think aloud with me. Peace, B out.
